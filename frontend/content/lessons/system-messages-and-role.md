# System Messages & Roles

**What you'll learn**
- System vs assistant vs user
- Behavior shaping with system messages
- Safety constraints

---

## Short summary

System messages (often the first message) tell the model its role and constraints; using them carefully yields safer and more useful responses.

---

## Key concepts

- **Role setting** — Define persona, style, and constraints.
- **Safety tokens** — Add instructions to refuse dangerous requests.
- **Temperature interplay** — System message + temperature affects output style.

---

## Exercise

- Create a system message that enforces concise bullet outputs.
- Test safety instructions for potentially risky prompts.
