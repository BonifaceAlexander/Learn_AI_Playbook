# Robustness & Adversarial Testing

**What you'll learn**
- Adversarial prompts
- Edge-case generation
- Defensive prompting

---

## Short summary

Robustness testing finds edge cases and adversarial prompts. Automated fuzzing and human review complement each other.

---

## Key concepts

- **Fuzzing** — Generate random inputs to stress the model.
- **Adversarial examples** — Craft inputs to expose failures.
- **Monitoring** — Track unexpected behaviors in production.

---

## Exercise

- Build a small fuzzer for prompt variations.
- Collect failure cases and create regression tests.
