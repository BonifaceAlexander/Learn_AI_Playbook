# Multimodal Introduction

**What you'll learn**
- Text+image basics
- Input preprocessing
- Use cases

---

## Short summary

Multimodal models handle text, images, and audio. Use case examples include captioning, VQA, and text+image assistants.

---

## Key concepts

- **Preprocessing** — Images need resizing/normalization; audio needs feature extraction.
- **Model types** — Vision transformers, audio encoders, and multimodal fusion.
- **Applications** — Captioning, image search, multimodal chat

---

## Exercise

- Try an image captioning API and compare outputs.
- Experiment with different image sizes.
