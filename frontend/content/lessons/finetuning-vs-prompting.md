# Fine-tuning vs Prompting

**What you'll learn**
- When to fine-tune
- Low-shot fine-tuning options
- Maintenance costs

---

## Short summary

Fine-tuning adapts model weights to a task; prompting tailors behavior without weight updates. Choose based on data, latency, and cost.

---

## Key concepts

- **Fine-tuning** — Improves performance but costs to maintain.
- **Prompting** — Faster iteration and lower infrastructure needs.
- **Hybrid** — Use retrieval + prompting before tuning.

---

## Exercise

- Compare a baseline prompt vs small fine-tune for a domain-specific task.
- Estimate costs.
